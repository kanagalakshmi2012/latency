**Abstract:**
In distributed clustered systems, efficient network resource resolution is vital for maintaining performance. DNS lookup with a database backend can cause latency and scalability challenges as cluster size grows, due to database query overhead, increased load, and contention. In contrast, host table lookups scale better with lower latency because they use simple in-memory mappings. However, database-backed DNS lookups degrade noticeably with larger clusters, impacting system responsiveness. This paper addresses these issues by optimizing DNS resolution through the use of host tables.

**Key Contributions:**
* Algorithm Development
  Designed and optimized hsot table lookup process to achieve high DNS resolution.
* Performance Comparison
  Conducted bench marking between DataBase DNS lookup time and Hsot Table lookup time.
* Reserach Leadership
  Led the research and technical implementation , focusing on advancing distributed database through algorithm innovation.
